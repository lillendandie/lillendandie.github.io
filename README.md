#Project
This Github Page is dedicated to showcasing my artwork. I am an inspiring illustrator and I needed a professional looking website. Although, I have some experience with HTML + CSS I'm still learning GitHub / Jekyll. If you have any ideas how I can improve feel free to email dandie.illustration (at) gmail (dot) com Thanks!
